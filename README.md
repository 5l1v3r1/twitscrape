twitscrape
==========
TwitScrape.rb is a ruby script which visits Twitter.com and grabs current trending topics. After grabbing these trending topics TwitScrape continues to download the most recent tweets mentioning those trends and stores them into a file.
TwitScrape is highly beneficial to password crackers who wish to generate non-specific wordlists which contain words being used by everyday people enmasse which may be indicators of common passwords or password "base" words.

TwitScrape depends on the following gems:

* Json
* Progress_bar
* Work_queue
* Mechanize
